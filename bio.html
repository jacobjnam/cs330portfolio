          <h2>Background Info</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio website. My name is Jacob
            Nam and I am currently a fourth-year studying for my B.S. in
            Computer Science at Northwestern University. I am a Korean American,
            with both of my parents immigrating from Korea. I have moved around
            the East Coast quite often as a child, being born in Pennsylvania,
            briefly living in Georgia, and currently residing in New Jersey.
            I am based in Evanston while at school and in New Jersey while
            staying with family (during winter and summer breaks).
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Background in Computer Science</h2>
          <p>
            I was exposed to computer science from middle school, working with
            Scratch to create simple games. The syntax was in the form of blocks
            that made writing code easy enough for a 13-year-old (e.g., an “if”
            statement would be its own block and had slots for the condition and
            function blocks). Writing programs in Scratch was like a puzzle to me:
            a puzzle that was more difficult, but as a result, more rewarding.
            I had fun with the coding assignments that we were given, consistently
            going beyond the teacher’s expectations. Unfortunately, however, my
            coding journey took a hiatus as my high school didn’t offer any
            computer science courses. Subsequently, the courses I took in high
            school focused on more “traditional” sciences, such as physics and chemistry.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time I began applying to colleges, my interest in computer
            science had died, but I still had no idea what I wanted to study.
            I applied to several schools that had a strong reputation in engineering,
            selecting “Undecided/Undeclared” for my preferred major. Come
            sophomore year, I still hadn’t decided my major. I took an introductory
            computer science course at the recommendation of my academic advisor
            and rekindled my interest in coding. After fall term, I officially
            declared my major.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recognize that my background in computer science is nowhere near
            as extensive as some of my peers; I began studying in the field
            fairly late, relative to my classmates. I fall short in terms of
            experience and projects, but I am constantly making efforts to close
            the gap.
          </p>
