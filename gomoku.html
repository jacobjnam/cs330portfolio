        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy game
          often compared to Tic-Tac-Toe. Originating in Japan, it has become
          popular across the globe, including countries like Korea, Britain,
          and the US. This project was coded in C++ and has several features
          that were implemented for better playability and convenience of the user(s).
        </p>

        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As the name “Five in a Row” suggests, the objective of Gomoku is for
          one player to connect five of their pieces before the other player is
          able to. It is a two-player game, where the players take turns placing
          their respective pieces (colored to differentiate between players) on
          a grid-like board. The board’s dimensions can vary from 9x9 to 15x15,
          and anything in between.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project was completed as a final assignment in CS211: Fundamentals
          of Computer Science II. The purpose of this project was to implement
          a game that demonstrates understanding of the C++ language.

        <h2>Game Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Once the program begins, a timer keeps track of the elapsed time.</li>
          <li>Each player's piece is represented by a black and white piece, respectively.</li>
          <li>The current player's piece is displayed on the mouse cursor, displaying over possible playable positions (grid positions that are not already occupied)</li>
          <li>When a player wins, the winning set of pieces is highlighted in blue and the screen displays a message that declares the winner.</li>
          <li>The program can be restarted by pressing the 'R' key at any time.</li>
