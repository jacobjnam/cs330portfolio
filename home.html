            Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy game
            often compared to Tic-Tac-Toe. Originating in Japan, it has become
            popular across the globe, including countries like Korea, Britain, and the US.
            This project was coded in C++ and has several features that were
            implemented for better playability and convenience of the user(s). <br>

          This personal portfolio website contains my personal projects, resume, biography,
          references, and contact information. The goal of this project is to demonstrate
          competence in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
